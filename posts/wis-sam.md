# Wireless Irrigation System (WIS):

### A. Specification :

WIS is designed to use WIFI so that it can be accessed via a compatible cellphone or laptop
browsers. WIS can be configured as an access point (standalone – without WIFI from outside) or
connected to existing WIFI, so it can be accessed from anywhere within the range of WIFI
connected.

The WIS function can be divided into the following tasks:

1. Irrigation Control/IC.

   In this irrigation control, WIS performs control independently and does not
   depending on other equipment (smart phone, laptop). WIS performs control
   based on parameter setting values ​​include:

   - Time to start irrigation
   - Duration of irrigation per group
   - Sequence / sequence of each group

   In detail the IC functions are:

   - Carry out control of the irrigation system with 4 groups (each 4
     bunds) using a solenoid valve.
   - The solenoid valve is connected to the WIS using a cable.
   - Alternating irrigation system between 4 group points a.
   - The length of irrigation time for each group is in accordance with the settings that have been given (in minutes)
   - Each activity (event) for each group will be recorded in the system and
     can be seen in the future.
   - Data storage time is 1 week (7 days)
   - The start of irrigation can also be arranged every day (eg starting at 06:00) and
     time can be changed.
   - Changes in each parameter (length of each group, start time of irrigation) can be
     done with a Smart phone, or with a laptop with WIFI.
   - Changes can only be made by authorized officers (complete with
     passwords and usernames).

2. Monitoring temperature and humidity (T, H) :

   WIS can be equipped with temperature sensors (T – Temperature) and humidity (H – Humidity)
   to measure the T,H of the environment where the sensor is installed. This measurement is taken by
   samples every 30 seconds. This value is then used for the next process
   in the following display:

   - WIS is also equipped with temperature and humidity sensors.
     for the surrounding environment.
   - Measurement results are displayed in the form of a dial-gauge and update in each
     minute.
   - The measurement results (T, H) can also be trended for 24 minutes (24 data).
   - Measurements (T, H) are also calculated hourly averages and stored daily
     for 1 week (7 days).
   - The average value at point d. above, you can also make reporting every day.
   - The form of all reporting is in a pdf file, so that it can be shared via WhatsApp or email
     separately.

3. Water Storage Control – WSC
   WIS can also control water reserves in storage tanks (ST – Storage Tanks) for irrigation. In this control, WIS is equipped with a height sensor
   water level (LS - Level Switch). LS provides information that is sent to WIS in the form of
   minimum and full signal level, then WIS processes the signal under control
   as follows:

- The well pump to the storage tank (ST) turns on when the storage tank reaches the fill level
  (level sensor) and will stop if the storage tank is full.
- The distribution pump will start during the irrigation period, and stop when it is finished.
- The distribution pump also stops when the storage tank reaches the minimum level
